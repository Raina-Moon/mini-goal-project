# Mini Goal Tracker - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Mini Goal Tracker application, built using React, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to set goals, track their progress with a timer, and share their achievements.

## Features

- **Goal Creation**: Users can create custom goals with a specified duration.
- **Timer Functionality**: A timer that tracks the duration of the goal. If the user switches tabs or leaves the app, the timer fails.
